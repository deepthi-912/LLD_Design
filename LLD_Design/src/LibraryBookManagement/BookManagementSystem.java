package LibraryBookManagement;
// We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Library Management System:
//
//        Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.
//        Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to physically locate the book.
//        There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.
//        The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
//        There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can check-out.
//        There should be a maximum limit (10) on how many days a member can keep a book.
//        The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.
//        Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
//        The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.
//        Each book and member card will have a unique barcode. The system will be able to read barcodes from books and membersâ€™ library cards.
